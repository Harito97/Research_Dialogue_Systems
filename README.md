# Dialogue Act Detection for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems  

## Objective

**Description**:  
This project implements a dialogue act detection system using the MultiWOZ dataset. Dialogue act detection is a fundamental task in building task-oriented dialogue systems, laying the groundwork for dialogue state tracking, policy generation, and response generation.  

Key features of this project include:  
- **Data Processing**: Extraction of (utterance, dialogue act) pairs from the MultiWOZ dataset and splitting into train/validation/test sets.  
- **Model Implementation**: Sequence labelling models using GRU, LSTM, and BERT encoders for dialogue act detection.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score to compare the effectiveness of different models.  
- **Documentation**: Detailed reports and notebooks explaining the methodology, implementation, and results.  

This repository is ideal for anyone interested in natural language processing (NLP), dialogue systems, or practical applications of sequence labelling techniques.
