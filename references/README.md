The following resources were referenced to complete this project:  

## **Theory**  

- **Comprehensive Guide**:  
  The primary theoretical framework is derived from *Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft)* by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin. This draft, dated August 20, 2024, provides an in-depth exploration of key concepts in speech and language processing. Additional resources include the [Outline](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) and the full [Draft Book](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book.pdf).  

- **Chapter 15 - Chatbots & Dialogue Systems**:  
  A focused study on [Chapter 15](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/15.pdf) of the same book, which delves into the fundamentals of chatbots and dialogue systems.  

- **Lecture Slides**:  
  Supplementary material includes the [Introduction to Chatbots and Dialogue Systems](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/slides/24_Dialogue_May_6_2021.pdf) slides for Chapter 15, which provide visual explanations and examples.  

## **Datasets & Research Papers**  

- **MultiWOZ 2.4 Dataset**:  
  A multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset with corrected annotations to improve state-tracking evaluation.
